# Simple XML Editor
A really simple XML editor that takes advantage of your browser!  

## TODO List  
 - [x] Format XML docoment  
 - [x] Show Doxument with GUI
 - [ ] Editing XML with GUI interactively
 - [ ] Release a Tauri application

## How To Use
Unfortunately, for now you have to install the tooling needed to develop the entire application to use it.  
- make sure you have `node` and `yarn`
- clone the repo  
- `yarn install`  
- `yarn dev`  

But, a Tauri application is on its way! Contribution is warmly welcomed!
